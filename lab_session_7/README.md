## Redesign of Lab-3

## Introduction -
The problem states to fetch the ticker symbols for the companies in the dataset that we have. Use the fuzzywuzzy logic and pandas reader to obtain the data in the desired manner. Join the two datasets on the Entity names so that it gives a picture of the stock prices and the records lost for each entity in the given year. Finally, develop a dashboard with a claim that supports/refutes the following claim
“The financial markets do not punish security breaches.”

## Objective-
The objective of this lab is to redeign the dashboard developed in lab-3 and document the scope of improvement.

## Data Source:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Je-YUdnhjQJO_13r8iTeRxpU2pBKuV6RVRHoYCgiMfg/edit#gid=322165570

## Claim-
The financial markets do not punish security breaches.

## Warrant-
The stock price of a company reflect its financial state in the global market. 

## Qualification-
Data for 252 companies

## Critique on Lab-3
In the above chart, I have picked up one of the web companies (YAHOO) that had a huge data breach and then analysed its stock price over those years.

Disadvantages -
- Hides the ups and downs in the stock price that might have happened at the moment of data breach.
- It does not reflect how much was it affected and how long did it take to recover.
- If we analyse the data on a monthly basis, we would get a clear picture of the impact on stock prices.
