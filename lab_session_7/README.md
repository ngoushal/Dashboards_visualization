## Redesign of Lab-3

The objective of this lab is to redeign the dashboard developed in lab-3 and document the ways we can improve.

### Critique on Lab-3
In the above chart, I have picked up one of the web companies (YAHOO) that had a huge data breach and then analysed its stock price over those years.

Disadvantages -
- Hides the ups and downs in the stock price that might have happened at the moment of data breach.
- It does not reflect how much was it affected and how long did it take to recover.
- If we analyse the data on a monthly basis, we would get a clear picture of the impact on stock prices.
