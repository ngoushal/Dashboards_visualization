## Redesign of Lab-3

The objective of this lab is to redeign the dashboard developed in lab-3 and document the ways we can improve.

### Critique on Lab-3
In the above chart, I have picked up one of the web companies (YAHOO) that had a huge data breach and then analysed its stock price over those years.

Disadvantages -

1)Hides the ups and downs in the stock price that might have happened at the moment of data breach.
2)It does not reflect how much was it affected and how long did it take to recover.
3)If we analyse the data on a monthly basis, we would get a clear picture of the impact on stock prices.
