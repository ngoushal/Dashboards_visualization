### Disadvantages -

- The above representation does not show what are the courses and skills offered by the MSIS program to the students.
- The chart shows the average salaries of the domains that a student can get into after graduating in MSIS from SCU, but does not tell how many people graduate from the university or what is the graduation rate.
- The bubble chart shows the top skills required for a student to obtain a job but does not show how many skills are required for job in a particular field. 

## Scope of improvement -

- The average experience of the students can be shown.
- Only the relevant domians can be highlighted and then the average salaries can be represented.
- The skills can be related to the job fields and it can be shown how many skills are required for each job.
- Graduation rate of the university can be shown so that the recruiters can offer jobs and be sure that the students will graduate in time.
- It can be shown what all skills does the university teach and how much is the experience or capability of each student.
- The success of alumni can also be shown.
- Leadership qualities of students can be shown.
