# Deaths caused by air pollution

## Introduction:
Air pollution can be defined as the emission of harmful substances to the atmosphere. This visualization project presents a global-level overview of air pollution: trends from history to the present day, the health and mortality burden and risk from air pollution. Air pollution is of two types: indoor (e.g. household) contexts and outdoor environments. This dataset focuses on outdoor pollution. 

## Motivation:
Air pollution is perceived as a modern-day curse: a by-product of increasing urbanisation and industrialisation. Air pollution has a range of negative impacts, including human health, damage to ecosystems, food crops and the built environment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) highlights air pollution as the greatest environmental risk to human health. The World Health Oranization estimates that 3 million people die from ambient outdoor pollution every year. Because of the huge impact on human health, i thought of going in-depth about this problem and figuring out the countries where it affects the most and its overall impact.

## Intended Audience:

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a data visualization that purposefully distorts the data or deceives the reader. The purpose of this project is for us to experience and realize the ethical implications of design decisions during the development of data visualizations.

## Scope of Improvement:

## Development Process:
A ‘death’ from air pollution is defined as someone who dies prematurely (could be in the range of months or years) than would be expected in the absence of air pollution. In many cases, air pollution exacerbates pre-existing cardiorespiratory illnesses—individuals suffering from asthma, for example, are particularly vulnerable. Researchers link pollution concentrations to health risks using empirical exposure-response relationships and their relation to mortality rates.

### Claim 1:
**Absolute number of deaths is increasing over the years**
Measuring absolute numbers of deaths (which you can explore here) from air pollution presents a number of drawbacks. The first is that the absolute number of deaths as a measure of air pollution is that it takes no account of population size or demographic. We might logically expect the number of deaths to be higher in countries with larger populations, and to increase in line with population growth. Similarly, we might expect the number of deaths to be higher in countries with an older population demographic.
Another drawback to the number of deaths is that it provides no indication of the age of the individuals included in these statistics; for example, a child who dies from an illness related to air pollution is counted exactly the same as an older individual who died a few months earlier than expected. 

### Claim 2:

Death rates from air pollution—across countries of all income levels—have shown a general decline over the last few decades. For many countries, the death rate has declined by more than 50 percent. This reduction trend is true, even in countries with a growing absolute number of deaths—China and India, for example. The increase in absolute number of deaths from air pollution is therefore a larger reflection of the changing population structures—a growing and aging population—rather than an increased individual risk of mortality.

### Map:
The visualisation below shows the absolute number of deaths attributed to outdoor air pollution by country from 1990-2016. At the annual level, the pollution-related deaths are dominated by China and India – each with between 1.1-1.2 million deaths in 2016. In the period since 1990, China’s increase in pollution-related deaths appears to be slowing with only a small increase since 2010. In contrast, India’s mortality rate from outdoor air pollution continues to increase.

## Conclusion:
Death rates are reported as age-standardized figures to allow for a fair cross-comparison of mortality and morbidity risk between countries and through time. Age-standardization normalises death rates to a set population structure (population size and age) to cancel out variation which would occur between countries based on population demographics. If rates were not age-standardized, a country with a larger or older population would report higher death rates than a smaller or younger country, even if levels of pollution exposure were the same.

## explaining death rate by air pollution
The reduction in death rates through time cannot be attributed to a reduction in pollution levels for a number of countries (in China and India, for example, death rates have fallen despite large increases in PM2.5 concentrations). This reduced risk of mortality must therefore be explained by external factors which improve overall health outcomes and vulnerability.

## explaining the number of deaths from air pollution
If the death rate across many countries is falling, why are the absolute number of deaths increasing? The absolute number of deaths is a function of three variable: the death rate, the population size, and the age demographic of the populace. If two countries have the same death rate, the country with the larger population, or older population will have the largest absolute number of deaths.

This has obvious implications for countries with a growing population. If the rate of population growth outpaces the reduction in death rates, then the absolute number of deaths will continue to grow
