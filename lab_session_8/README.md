### Disadvantages -

- The above representation shows the rank of Santa Clara University in California i.e. 26th which is not very attractive.
- The chart shows the average salaries of the domians that a student can get into after graduating in MSIS from SCU, but does not tell how many people graduate from the university.
- The bubble chart shows the top skills required for a student to obtain a job but does not show how many skills are required for job in a particular field. 

## Scope of improvement -

- The rank of Santa Clara University in California can be highlighted as its in the top 3.
- The domians can be grouped in 2-3 categories and then the average salaries can be represented.
- The skills can be related to the job fields and it can be shown how many skills are required for each job.
- It can also be shown that how much can be earned per skill.
- It can be compared how many relevant skills do Santa Clara teach as compared to the other universities for the same program.
- The success of alumni can also be shown.
